Prerequisites
-------------

pyncho depends on the Cheetah template engine: http://cheetahtemplate.org

Installation
------------

To set up your blog and your .pyncho/rc file:

  pyncho prepare

Configuration
-------------

If you don't change output_path in .pyncho/rc the finished HTML will be put
in .pyncho/output. Also make sure you set `baseurl` to something clever,
because the Atom feed wants an absolute URL.
