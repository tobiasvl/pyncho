Known bugs
----------

- NOTE: This might have been fixed in Cheetah 2.4.4 but there's no changelog
  for that version so who knows. Will test properly some day but generating
  HTML seems to work in Python 2.7 and Cheetah 2.4.4 now.

  There is a bug in Python 2.7 that causes problems with Cheetah (the template
  enginge). For more information, read here:
